        <li>
            CSS describes how HTML, elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in other media.</li>  <br>
            <li>
                <del> CSS is not necessary</del>
                <span class="s1">CSS saves a lot of work</span>. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>   <br>

    <h1>CSS Can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways</h1>
    <br>
    <div class="space">   <ul>
        <li>
            Inline- by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1
        </li>
        <li>Internal- by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External- by using a link element tyo link to an external CSS file</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS. is to keep the styles in external CSS files. however,
            <span><b>in this tutorials we will use inline and internal styles</b></span> 
            , because this is easier to demonstrate,and easier for you to try it yourself</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="p1">When comparing CSS class vs ID,the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.ID, on the other hand,applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL.to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</p>  
    
<p class="p2" >In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a webpage. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the elements.</p>  

    <p class="p3">There is a wide range of selectors available.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied</p>
